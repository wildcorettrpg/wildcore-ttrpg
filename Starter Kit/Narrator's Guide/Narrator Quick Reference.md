# Narrator Quick Reference

This document covers everything you need to run *The Weight of Silence*. For deeper reading on any rule, references to the Velocity Core Rules are provided.

## The Core Loop

Every contested action in Velocity resolves as an **Opposition Check**: both sides assemble a dice pool plus an Attribute bonus. Highest total wins. A tie is a stalemate — narrate forward without declaring a winner.

**How to build a total:**

1. Start with 1d10 (always, for everyone)
2. Add flat bonuses from applicable skills
3. Add the relevant Attribute score
4. Add any additional dice granted by skills at higher tiers

The Narrator rolls the opposition privately and announces the outcome descriptively — not as numbers, but as what happens in the fiction.

[Core Rules reference: Opposition Checks — Core Procedure](Core%20Rules/Encounters/Opposition%20Checks.md#core-procedure)

## When to Call for a Roll

Not every action needs a check. Opposition Checks are required only when:

1. The outcome is **genuinely uncertain**
2. The action occurs **in combat**
3. Rolling **heightens narrative stakes**

When none of these apply, compare the character's **opposition score** (relevant Attribute + flat skill bonuses, no dice) against a difficulty you assign. If they meet or exceed it, they succeed automatically. No roll needed.

**Difficulty benchmarks:**

| Difficulty | Range |
|------------|-------|
| Trivial | 1–3 |
| Routine | 4–7 |
| Challenging | 8–13 |
| Dangerous | 14–16 |
| Extreme | 17–20 |

[Core Rules reference: Opposition Checks — When to Make an Opposition Check](Core%20Rules/Encounters/Opposition%20Checks.md#when-to-make-an-opposition-check) · [Opposition Check Difficulty Table](Core%20Rules/Tables/Opposition%20Check%20Difficulty%20Table.md)

---

## Action Points

Each participant gets **3 AP per turn**. AP pays for:

- Actions (attacks, abilities, skill uses): 1–3 AP each
- Movement: 1 AP = full base movement
- Reactions: 1 AP, usable outside your turn (max 1 per round)

Unspent AP does not carry over.

**Attacks:** The first attack each turn has no penalty. Each additional attack in the same turn incurs a cumulative −2 penalty. A character's flat attack bonuses directly offset this penalty.

[Core Rules reference: Actions — Action Points](Core%20Rules/Encounters/Actions.md#actions)

## Attributes Quick Reference

| Attribute | Used For |
|-----------|----------|
| Fortitude | Resisting poison, disease, exhaustion, environmental hazards |
| Reflex | Defensive rolls (Dodge, Parry, Block) |
| Social | Persuasion, Intimidation, Negotiation, Domination |
| Strength | Melee and ranged attack rolls; bonus damage |
| Willpower | Magic attack rolls; Consciousness Checks; bonus spell damage |

**Vitality** is not an assignable attribute and is not used in Opposition Checks. It sets maximum Health (base 25 for all characters). It increases only through the Vitality skill tree, race traits, or specific abilities — never through creation-time point assignment.

[Core Rules reference: Attributes — Core Attributes](Core%20Rules/Characters/Attributes.md#core-attributes)

---

## Defense Options

When a character is attacked, they choose one defense:

- **Dodge:** Always available. Dice pool from Dodge-granting skills + Reflex. −2 penalty when severely restricted (cornered, restrained, no open ground within 5 ft).
- **Parry:** Requires a weapon. Dice pool from Parry-granting skills + Reflex.
- **Block:** Requires a shield or similar. Dice pool from Block-granting skills + Reflex.

**Against spells:**

- Physical/elemental spells (fire, lightning, force): Dodge only.
- Mind-affecting spells (charm, compulsion, fear): Dice pool + Willpower.

## Armor

Armor mitigates damage after a hit lands — it does not affect whether the attack succeeds.

Characters in this adventure wearing light armor (leather, mitigation 3) subtract 3 from every physical hit before applying damage to Health. Magic weapons, spells, and magical abilities bypass armor entirely.

[Core Rules reference: Armor](Core%20Rules/Equipment/Armor.md#armor)

---

## Health and Dying

- **Base Vitality:** 25 (modified by the Vitality skill tree and race traits)
- **Wounded threshold:** Half of max Vitality, rounded up. At base Vitality 25, this is **13 Health**.
- **Dying threshold:** One quarter of max Vitality, rounded up. At base Vitality 25, this is **7 Health**.
- **Death:** Health reaches 0.

When a character's Health drops to or below the **Wounded threshold**:

- They enter the **Wounded** condition and begin [Bleeding Out](../../Core%20Rules/Conditions%20and%20Hazards/Conditions.md#bleeding-out): 1 Health lost per round at end of their turn.
- No OC penalty. No movement penalty. They can still act normally — they're hurt, not impaired.
- Kith and Kin must make a Willpower OC (difficulty 20) at the start of each turn or enter blood rage.

When Health drops further to or below the **Dying threshold**:

- They enter the **Dying** condition: −2 on all Opposition Checks, movement reduced by 5 ft per AP.
- They are still [Bleeding Out](../../Core%20Rules/Conditions%20and%20Hazards/Conditions.md#bleeding-out) (started at Wounded).
- They must make a **Consciousness Check** (1d10 + Willpower vs. the damage that triggered it). Failure = unconscious.
- They can still act if they pass the Consciousness Check.

Stabilization ends [Bleeding Out](../../Core%20Rules/Conditions%20and%20Hazards/Conditions.md#bleeding-out) and Consciousness Checks but does not remove the Wounded or Dying conditions. Those end only when Health is healed above the relevant threshold.

Going unconscious is not death — it is a story problem.

[Core Rules reference: Dying](Core%20Rules/Characters/Dying.md)

---

## Stabilization

A conscious character can stabilize an unconscious, bleeding-out ally. Stabilization stops the bleeding and ends Consciousness Checks. It does not restore Health or remove the [Unconscious](../../Core%20Rules/Conditions%20and%20Hazards/Conditions.md#unconscious) condition — a stabilized character remains unconscious until healed.

A character with Healing skills and a Healer's Bag can restore Health: 1d6 + Willpower per charge (10 charges). Without tools, stabilization alone is available.

## Social and Investigation Scenes

Velocity's social resolution uses the same Opposition Check framework as combat. The difference is what's at stake.

**Key principles for running social scenes:**

- **NPCs resist based on their interests, not a fixed number.** A guard who wants to keep his job resists differently than a guard who's already been paid. Set difficulty based on the NPC's motivation.
- **A failed check doesn't end the scene.** It changes what's available. The guard doesn't let the player in — but the player is still standing there.
- **Stalemates are forward motion.** When both sides tie, narrate a moment of tension and let the scene evolve. Nobody wins and nobody loses.

**Investigation checks** reveal information. Set difficulty based on how obscure the information is. A successful check delivers what the player was looking for. A failed check delivers nothing — or delivers something that creates a new question.

## Awarding Skill Points

Skill Points are awarded by the Narrator at the end of the session — never mid-session.

For *The Weight of Silence*, suggested awards:

- **1 SP** to every player who completed the session (attendance award — decide at session zero whether to use this)
- **1 SP** to the whole party if they resolved the conspiracy and freed Kalen (story milestone)
- **1 SP** to any individual player who drove a pivotal moment — a clever investigative leap, a crucial social check, a decision that changed the shape of the session (exceptional play, not guaranteed)

Maximum possible: 3 SP. A typical session awards 1–2 SP.

## Running the Ticking Clock

*The Weight of Silence* uses a two-hour recess as its clock. The Narrator controls how this feels at the table.

**Tools for maintaining urgency:**

- A bell tower that strikes the hour
- An NPC mentioning that the verdict is due soon
- Voss or his guards moving through town with visible purpose
- The Belar delegation's presence, visible through a window or in passing

**Do not enforce the clock mechanically.** The two hours are a narrative device, not a timer on the table. If players are engaged and making meaningful choices, let the scene breathe. If they're stalling, accelerate. The Narrator's dramatic judgment is final.
