# WildCore TTRPG

A narrative-first tabletop roleplaying game built for emotionally intense, relationship-driven stories. Combat is a punctuation mark, not the core loop. The rules stay out of the way so the story can move.

The `Website/reader/` directory and search index files are build artifacts — they are not committed to the repository and are generated fresh on every deploy.

## Building locally

Node.js is the only dependency (no npm packages required).

```bash
cd Website
node build.js
```

Output is written to `Website/reader/` and `Website/search-index.*`. Open any `.html` file in `Website/` to browse locally.

---

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` automatically triggers the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages. No manual build step needed.

The workflow fires when `.md` source files, the build script, the stylesheet, or hand-maintained site pages change.
